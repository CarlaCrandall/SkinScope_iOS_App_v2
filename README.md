SkinScope iOS App v2
===========================

SkinScope is a native iOS app designed to help consumers quickly and easily research skincare products before puchasing. 

This app is a prototype. **[View the deck](http://www.slideshare.net/CarlaCrandall/skinscope-ios-app-process-annotated-designs)** for a full list of planned features and a preview of the UI.

2. SkinScope also uses the [ZBar iPhone SDK](http://zbar.sourceforge.net/iphone/sdkdoc/).
